# Simple C++ REPL/Shell
**cppREPL** is a stupidly simple interactive shell built on top of the compiler of your choice. 
It behaves as a wrapper around the chosen compiler to emulate an interactive session with various
features.

I started this as a simple way to prototype quickly in C++ and from my experience with Python's interactive shell. 

# Plans
I plan to implement some sort of support for C, C++, and possibly CUDA sessions using the available compiler on your system or specified compiler.
